# RainRadar

[![Screenshot of the program](/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot of the main application window of RainRadar")](/screenshot.png?raw=true).

RainRadar is a nifty and simple viewer to display the meteorological rain radar maps of Germany since it has been started. It fetches the radar images from [wetter.info](wetter.info), stores them internally and displays them as continuous looping _(sort of)_ video.
